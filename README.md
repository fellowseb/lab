#Welcome, dear guest !

Let me introduce myself! My name is Sébastien. I'm a French and British citizen and have been working as a Sofware Engineer for more than seven years now.

This repository will contain the source code for my personal website (or portfolio, if you like) entitled **A Modest Learning Journey**.
My intention is to experiment various areas of interest and report my results, my feelings, along with links to the resources I used to accomplish the experiment. **I think life should be an eternal learning process**. My hope is that this forces me to keep up with the good work!
A few examples of domains I'd definitely like to take a (deeper) look at include:
* **technology**: ES6/7/8, React.js, NoSQL databases, IoT, Blockchain, dApps, WebAssembly, WebGL, Docker, Machine Learning/Deep Learning, Algorithms, Python, Data Visualisation, etc.
* **arts**: Music Theory, Demoscene and other computer art subcultures, Painting, Calligraphy, etc.
* **life**: Sports (Muay Thaï/fitness programs, one-time events such as The Spartan Race), Environment, Humanitarian/Social Work, etc.

As soon as the portfolio is up and running I'll let you know the URL, don't worry :).
